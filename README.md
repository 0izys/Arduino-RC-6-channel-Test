# Arduino RC 6-channel Test
This test program takes input signals from an RC flight controller and maps them to pulse width modulated values that can be output onto LEDs. This project was created as a proof of concept for using RC technology together with the Arduino platform.

A later version of this program will be created to work with a 10-channel transmitter/receiver system.

Currently, this is being tested using a FlySky FS-i6 flight controller transmitter with a FlySky ia6b 6-channel receiver. In the near future I will be modifying the transmitter to allow it to use a full 10 channels to be used with a FlySky ia10b receiver.
